Execute the BMAD '{{name}}' workflow.

CRITICAL: This is a structured YAML workflow that requires the workflow engine.

1. LOAD the workflow engine at {project-root}/{{bmadFolderName}}/core/tasks/workflow.xml
2. READ its entire contents - this is the CORE OS for executing YAML workflows
3. Pass the YAML path {project-root}/{{bmadFolderName}}/{{workflow_path}} as 'workflow-config' parameter
4. Follow workflow.xml instructions EXACTLY as written to process the workflow config
5. Save outputs after EACH section when generating documents from templates
