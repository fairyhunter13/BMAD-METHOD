**Build More Architect Dreams** — An AI-driven agile development module for the BMad Method Module Ecosystem, the best and most comprehensive Agile AI Driven Development framework that has true scale-adaptive intelligence that adjusts from bug fixes to enterprise systems.

**100% free and open source.** No paywalls. No gated content. No gated Discord. We believe in empowering everyone, not just those who can pay for a gated community or courses.

## Why the BMad Method?

Traditional AI tools do the thinking for you, producing average results. BMad agents and facilitated workflows act as expert collaborators who guide you through a structured process to bring out your best thinking in partnership with the AI.

- **AI Intelligent Help** — Invoke the `bmad-help` skill anytime for guidance on what's next
- **Scale-Domain-Adaptive** — Automatically adjusts planning depth based on project complexity
- **Structured Workflows** — Grounded in agile best practices across analysis, planning, architecture, and implementation
- **Specialized Agents** — 12+ domain experts (PM, Architect, Developer, UX, and more)
- **Party Mode** — Bring multiple agent personas into one session to collaborate and discuss
- **Complete Lifecycle** — From brainstorming to deployment

## 🚀 What's Next for BMad?

**V6 is here and we're just getting started!** The BMad Method is evolving rapidly with optimizations including Cross Platform Agent Team and Sub Agent inclusion, Skills Architecture, BMad Builder v1, Dev Loop Automation, and so much more in the works.

**[📍 Check out the complete Roadmap →](https://docs.bmad-method.org/roadmap/)**

---

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites**: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v20+ · [Python](https://www.python.org) 3.10+ · [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

```bash
npx bmad-fh install
```

> If you are getting a stale version, use: `npx bmad-fh@latest install`

Follow the installer prompts, then open your AI IDE (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) in your project folder.

**Non-Interactive Installation** (for CI/CD):

```bash
npx bmad-fh install --directory /path/to/project --modules bmm --tools claude-code --yes
```

[See all installation options](https://docs.bmad-method.org/how-to/non-interactive-installation/)

> **Not sure what to do?** Ask `bmad-help` — it tells you exactly what's next and what's optional. You can also ask questions like `bmad-help I just finished the architecture, what do I do next?`

## Modules

BMad Method extends with official modules for specialized domains. Available during installation or anytime after.

## Multi-Scope Parallel Development

BMad supports running multiple workflows in parallel across different terminal sessions with isolated artifacts. Perfect for:

- **Multi-team projects** — Each team works in their own scope
- **Parallel feature development** — Develop auth, payments, and catalog simultaneously
- **Microservices** — One scope per service with shared contracts
- **Experimentation** — Create isolated scopes for spikes and prototypes

### Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize scope system
npx bmad-fh scope init

# Create a scope (you'll be prompted to activate it)
npx bmad-fh scope create auth --name "Authentication Service"
# ✓ Scope 'auth' created successfully!
# ? Set 'auth' as your active scope for this session? (Y/n)

# Run workflows - artifacts now go to _bmad-output/auth/
# The active scope is stored in .bmad-scope file

# For parallel development, prefer PARALLEL-SAFE scope selection:
# Terminal 1:
export BMAD_SCOPE=auth
# Terminal 2:
export BMAD_SCOPE=payments
# Or pass inline scope per command/window (recommended): /workflow-prd --scope auth

# Optional: keep .bmad-scope but disable it (workflows ignore it)
npx bmad-fh scope file-disable
# Re-enable later
npx bmad-fh scope file-enable

# Share artifacts between scopes
npx bmad-fh scope sync-up auth       # Promote to shared layer
npx bmad-fh scope sync-down payments # Pull shared updates
```

> **Important:** Workflows only use scoped directories when a scope is active.
> For parallel work, prefer inline `--scope`, conversation `/scope <id>`, or `BMAD_SCOPE` env var.
> `.bmad-scope` is a shared file (NOT parallel-safe) and can be disabled with `npx bmad-fh scope file-disable`.

  --name "Authentication Service" \
  --description "User auth, SSO, and session management" \
  --deps users,notifications \
  --context  # Create scope-specific project-context.md
```

### Directory Structure

After initialization and scope creation:

```
project-root/
├── _bmad/
│   ├── _config/
│   │   └── scopes.yaml          # Scope registry and settings
│   └── _events/
│       ├── event-log.yaml       # Event history
│       └── subscriptions.yaml   # Cross-scope subscriptions
│
├── _bmad-output/
│   ├── _shared/                 # Shared knowledge layer
│   │   ├── project-context.md   # Global project context
│   │   ├── contracts/           # Integration contracts
│   │   └── principles/          # Architecture principles
│   │
│   ├── auth/                    # Auth scope artifacts
│   │   ├── planning-artifacts/
│   │   ├── implementation-artifacts/
│   │   └── tests/
│   │
│   └── payments/                # Payments scope artifacts
│       └── ...
│
└── .bmad-scope                  # Shared active scope marker (gitignored; can be disabled with enabled: false)
```

### Access Model

Scopes follow a "read-any, write-own" isolation model:

| Operation | Own Scope | Other Scopes | _shared/   |
| --------- | --------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| **Read**  | Allowed   | Allowed      | Allowed     |
| **Write** | Allowed   | Blocked      | via sync-up |

### Workflow Integration

Workflows automatically detect scope context using this **priority order**:

| Priority | Source                    | Parallel-Safe | Example                            |
| -------- | ------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1        | Inline `--scope` flag     | Yes           | `/workflow-prd --scope auth`       |
| 2        | Conversation memory       | Yes           | Earlier `/scope auth` in same chat |
| 3        | `BMAD_SCOPE` env var      | Yes           | `export BMAD_SCOPE=auth`           |
| 4        | `.bmad-scope` file        | **No**        | Set via `scope set auth`           |
| 5        | Prompt user (if required) | Yes           | Interactive selection              |

**For parallel development**, always use inline scope or set scope at conversation start:

```bash
# Parallel-safe: inline scope (recommended)
/workflow-prd --scope auth

# Parallel-safe: set at conversation start
/scope auth
/workflow-prd   # Uses auth from conversation memory

# NOT parallel-safe: shared file (single terminal only)
npx bmad-fh scope set auth

# Disable shared file without deleting it
npx bmad-fh scope file-disable
```

**Scope-aware path variables in workflows:**

- `{scope}` → Scope ID (e.g., "auth")
- `{scope_path}` → `_bmad-output/auth`
- `{planning_artifacts}` → `_bmad-output/auth/planning-artifacts`
- `{implementation_artifacts}` → `_bmad-output/auth/implementation-artifacts`
- `{scope_tests}` → `_bmad-output/auth/tests`

### Getting Help

```bash
# Show comprehensive help for all scope commands
npx bmad-fh scope help

# Get detailed help for a specific command
npx bmad-fh scope help create
npx bmad-fh scope help sync-up
```
